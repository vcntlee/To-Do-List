# To-Do-List

This is my Hello World Android App. 

It is a To-Do app that allows for:
- addition of a task
- update an existing task
- check out a task
- delete a task

Here's a quick tour of the app:

Here's a list of the requirements:
- user can add and remove items
- user can edit
- user's data persists

Here's a list of some additional features:
- improved UI
- used SQLite for data persistence
- task completed and task deletion are portrayed differently:
    - task completed just creates a strike through text style
    - task deleted actually deletes entry
- priority of each task is color coded
- created a spash screen
